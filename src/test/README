Unit tests for zCall/src

Author: Iain Bancarz, ib5@sanger.ac.uk

Tests should be run from the src subdirectory of the zCall source code, as cloned from Github.  They are run by executing test/run_tests.sh. This runs the Python unit tests and cleans up test output (in a way which avoids errors on NFS).

The tests require a correctly populated 'bigdata' directory, specified in etc/config.ini.  Bigdata contains test files which are too large to upload to github and/or contain confidental data:
- GTC files with intensities and genotype calls. These contain confidential human data. (Eventually these will be replaced by synthetic data without confidentality concerns.)
- EGT files: HumanOmniExpress-12v1-1_b.egt and HumanExome-12v1.egt, available from http://support.illumina.com/downloads.ilmn.
- BPM file: A .bpm.csv file corresponding to the EGT file and manifest for the GTC files.
- gtc.json file: A .json file containing paths to the GTC files.
  Threshold inputs: The file thresholds.json containing paths to 3 threshold.txt files, which were generated from the EGT file for z scores (6,7,8).
- Merge inputs: The file evaluation_metrics.json contains paths to additional .json files metrics00.json, metrics01.json, which serve as input to the 'merge evaluation' test.

The Python tests examine the MD5 checksums of output files generated from the above input.
